# Playwright

Browser automation using Playwright.

## MCP Servers

Plugin bundles two Playwright MCP servers:

| Server | Mode | Use case |
|--------|------|----------|
| `browsing` | Headed | Debugging, staying logged in |
| `browsing-headless` | Headless | Automated checks, clean state |

No manual MCP setup required — servers start automatically when plugin is enabled.
