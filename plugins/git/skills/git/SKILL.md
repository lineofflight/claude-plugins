# Git Conventions

## Commits

- Follow existing project conventions (check recent commits, commitlint config, etc.)
- If no conventions found: imperative mood, capitalized, <50 chars
- Body only when necessary (blank line, 72 char wrap)
- Don't add attribution (e.g. "Co-Authored-By")

## Branches

- Work on feature branches, not main
- Use worktrees for parallel work; clean up when done
