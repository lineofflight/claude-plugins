# Playwright

Browser automation using Playwright.

Plugin provides a headless Playwright MCP server and a skill that guides the agent on use. Browser sessions persist across conversations per project. The skill delegates browsing to subagents that absorb all the navigation and snapshotting, acting as a token firewall for context hygiene.
